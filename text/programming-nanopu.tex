\section{Programming the NanoPU}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Applications must be written such that they process network messages in FIFO order.
    \item Applications should have minimal memory requirements, such that the working set fits in on-chip SRAM. In fact, the code and data of all nanoservice threads pinned to the core must fit in on-chip SRAM.
    \item Nanoservice applications are composed of many single threaded nanoservers that are pinned to a specific NanoPU core. These single threaded applications exchange messages directly with one another. Load balancing decisions are performed either at the application level or in the network switches.
    \item The NanoPU transport protocol supports reliable one way message delivery. It also supports mechanisms to support RPC style request/response protocols layered on top of the transport.
