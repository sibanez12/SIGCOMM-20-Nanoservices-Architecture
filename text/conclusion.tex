\section{Conclusion}
We believe that compute-intensive distributed applications would be designed very differently than they are today if utilizing remote computation is predictably only slightly more expensive than local computation.
We believe that these applications would be implemented in an extremely fine grained manner - using the nanoservices framework.
The NanoPU described in this paper is the first step towards making nanoservices a reality.
There is still much work to be done.
For example, designing an optimal transport protocol for nanoservices, rethinking the NanoPU's memory architecture, as well as potentially its instruction set architecture (ISA).
